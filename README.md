# kddockwidgets-reference-test-screenshots

Submodule of KDDockWidgets, contains reference test images.

This repo is only relevant for people developing [KDDockWidgets](https://github.com/KDAB/KDDockWidgets).
When running tests, images of the GUI are produced automatically and matched against these reference ones,
to catch regressions.

For now, only the flutter frontend will be using this.
